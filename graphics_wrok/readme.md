Nothing really groundbreaking but I thought it's a good idea to share this

here I'm just trying to make a trail with the points of the circle trailing behind. 
Next step is to make the trail smoother and actually look like a sin wave instead of what's shown up there. 
To do this I'll make horizontal line going to a vertical one standing to the right of the circle and the trail drawing will begin from that point. Additionally, there needs to be more points for trail than there is for the circle since the frames skipped in drawing the path in the circle appear more clearly in the trail.
