# This is my first try making animations with pillow

Nothing really groundbreaking but I thought it's a good idea to share this


# I'm trying to build up to making pictures with the fourier transform

here I'm just trying to make a trail with the points of the circle trailing behind. 
Next step is to make the trail smoother and actually look like a sin wave instead of what's shown up there. 
To do this I'll make horizontal line going to a vertical one standing to the right of the circle and the trail drawing will begin from that point. Additionally, there needs to be more points for trail than there is for the circle since the frames skipped in drawing the path in the circle appear more clearly in the trail.

This looks fairly clean. It's not very high resolution, but I think it looks good enough. Next step is to try adding more circles and to view the addition of those in a clean way as well.
