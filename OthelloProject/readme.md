# Othello game & software that plays the game
The purpose of this project is to make a functional version of the board game othello and to make an AI that plays that game optimally.
The rules for Othello are linked here [Rules](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/reversi-othello-rules.htm)
I think we can get away with making a text interface for the game while testing. and then just get a stream for every position once we know
that the implementation is okay. We can use that then to make an AI or something. 
Good luck to us.
