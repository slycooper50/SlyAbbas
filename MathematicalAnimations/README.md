This folder of the repo contains mathematical animations using the manim package created by Grant Sanderson. This package is a python package. It generates big tex folder size of approx (30Gb).

In order to generate the animations do the following:
'1- Clone the manim repo from here.'
'2- python dir/manimlib/manim.py XX.py'

This will generate a media folder you can explore and you will find .mp4 files in there.
